# This files lists the minimum set of packages that we need for QMS/QMT
# Version locking and explicit dependencies are kept to a minimum. If any they are explained,
# and could potentially be removed in the future
# This file is kept around so that if we want to upgrade version numbers, we can conda build
# on this. If not please use environment_full_[platform].yml, which is much less likely to give you issues
# due to packages versioning
